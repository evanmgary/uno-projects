For Part 1:
The code is for the easy example. However it does work for the bonus if the appropriate .h files are placed in the
parent directory of the directory the java file and file1 are in.
Run by entering the name of the file to preprocess as a command line argument. 
The preprocessor creates a text file called ResultFile in the working directory as output.

For Part 2:
The maxSubSum4Mod method is included in the same runner class as the preprocessor. It is a static method of 
class Homework1. So, use it by entering Homework1.maxSubSum4Mod(data). The test class takes care of this. It returns
an MSPAnswer object.
